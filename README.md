# Subway-Builder-Cheat-Engine
Have you ever launched a system on subway builder and messed up ? but you don't want to restart ? me too ! This small python script was made for people like you and me who are terrible planners !

# How to Use

Put your Subway Builder save file in this folder.

Rename the save file exactly to:

save.metro

Double-click:

run.bat

When the black window opens, type the amount of money you want.

Press Enter.

The tool will create a new file called:

save_modified.metro

Use this file in the game.

## Important

After replacing your save file, completely close and restart the game.

Subway Builder caches save data in memory. If you do not restart the game, the money will not update.

## Backup

A backup of your original save is automatically created:

save_backup.metro
MAKE ANOTHER ONE JUST IN CASE

If something goes wrong, restore this file.
